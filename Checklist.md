#Checklist Errors
Worked with Rob Martorano rfm21

Discussed public errors in the XMLReader and how to fix it. Unfortunately, was unable to complete the implementation, but we decided to make all the public HashMap/ArrayLists into more general returns of Maps and Lists. Need to adjust all the connected code to accommodate said changes.
